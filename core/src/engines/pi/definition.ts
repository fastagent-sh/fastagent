/**
 * Definition domain: read an agent definition folder (AGENTS.md + skills/) into
 * memory, and materialize it into a deployable artifact. No dependency on agent
 * creation — this module produces data; create.ts consumes it.
 *
 * Domain note: the definition CONCEPT is engine-neutral (AGENTS.md / agentskills
 * are cross-product standards — the definition is input to a harness, never part
 * of it). This IMPLEMENTATION is pi-folded (pi's loadSkills / Skill types) per the
 * folded-M decision; lift it out of engines/pi when engine #2 lands.
 *
 * IO policy (the precise form of the "core does not read disk" invariant):
 *   - the runtime load path (loadAgentDefinition) does IO **only through ExecutionEnv**
 *     (portable: local / sandbox / remote envs);
 *   - bundleAgentDefinition is a **build-time** operation and uses node:fs directly
 *     (it runs on the build machine by definition);
 *   - the invoke path (invoke.ts/harness.ts) never touches the disk itself;
 *   - config.ts / auth.ts / sessions.ts (and create.ts's L3 workspace-state setup)
 *     are Node composition-root code and may use node fs.
 *
 * Error conventions on this path:
 *   - ExecutionEnv layer returns Result (pi's contract);
 *   - this module converts Results to **throws** (a broken definition should fail
 *     loudly at startup, not at first invoke);
 *   - non-fatal load findings (bad skill files, name collisions) are returned as
 *     data (diagnostics/collisions) for the caller to surface — visible, not fatal.
